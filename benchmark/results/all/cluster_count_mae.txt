This is a grouped vertical bar chart. Its title is performance for the cluster counting task. The y-axis legend is MAE. The x-axis legend is model. The chart is made up of 10 groups of bars: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, o3, o4-mini, Flash, Flash-Lite, Flash-Lite (Thinking). Each group contains three bars: zero-shot prompt, one-shot, few-shot, which will be presented in that order. The first group of bars is GPT-4.1 and has values 0.39, 0.15, 0.05. The second group of bars is GPT-4.1 mini and has values 0.55, 0.36, 0.06. The third group of bars is GPT-4.1 nano and has values 0.62, 0.76, 0.7. The fourth group of bars is GPT-4o and has values 0.74, 0.28, 0.12. The fifth group of bars is GPT-4o mini and has values 0.69, 0.77, 0.56. The sixth group of bars is o3 and has values 0.41, 0.22, 0.03. The seventh group of bars is o4-mini and has values 1.26, 0.88, 0.15. The eighth group of bars is Flash and has values 0.75, 0.72, 0.06. The ninth group of bars is Flash-Lite and has values 0.91, 1.14, 0.57. The tenth group of bars is Flash-Lite (Thinking) and has values 1.11, 1.46, 0.22.
