This is a grouped vertical bar chart. Its title is performance for the outlier counting task. The y-axis legend is MAE. The x-axis legend is model. The chart is made up of 10 groups of bars: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1 nano, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, o3, o4-mini, Flash, Flash-Lite, Flash-Lite (Thinking). Each group contains three bars: zero-shot prompt, one-shot, few-shot, which will be presented in that order. The first group of bars is GPT-4.1 and has values 6.79, 6.2, 2.46. The second group of bars is GPT-4.1 mini and has values 7.68, 4.34, 2.26. The third group of bars is GPT-4.1 nano and has values 2.78, 0.97, 0.88. The fourth group of bars is GPT-4o and has values 4.09, 1.01, 0.29. The fifth group of bars is GPT-4o mini and has values 1.66, 0.97, 1.27. The sixth group of bars is o3 and has values 10.77, 10.41, 11.2. The seventh group of bars is o4-mini and has values 10.72, 12.64, 18.54. The eighth group of bars is Flash and has values 3.56, 2.09, 0.47. The ninth group of bars is Flash-Lite and has values 3.34, 3.69, 4.11. The tenth group of bars is Flash-Lite (Thinking) and has values 1.45, 1.07, 1.47.
